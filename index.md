# CUSO Graduate Colloquium 2024

#### University of Bern, Switzerland
**06. - 08. November 2024**

The CUSO Graduate Colloquium is the most popular (and also traditional) CUSO activity,
where PhD students present their research topic to fellow students.
They get to know each other and learn a lot of mathematics outside of their field of expertise.

We are very excited that this year's CUSO Graduate Colloquium is taking place at the University of Bern!
