The incompressible Euler system is a universal model describing conservation of momentum in an incompressible ideal fluid, i.e. a system where particles cannot compress and do not experience any internal friction. Despite being a closed system, it is experimentally and numerically checked that the kinetic energy gets dissipated along the time evolution. We investigate qualitative properties of the geometric structure of the set where the anomalous inviscid dissipation accumulates.
