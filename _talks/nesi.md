After a brief introduction to the continuity equation, we discuss the uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problem. We will see that the presence of a boundary will introduce some difficulties in the non-smooth setting, already at the level of defining weak solutions. 
Finally we present the two notions of normal trace that are needed and, time permitting, talk about their link to other areas of analysis.
