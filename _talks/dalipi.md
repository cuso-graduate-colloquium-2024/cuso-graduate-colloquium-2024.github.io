Recent works indicate that the moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics on surfaces with boundary possess natural symplectic structures. We will specialize in the disk with punctures case, where I will explain how this relates with moduli spaces of flat connections, and give a recipe for computing the symplectic form.
