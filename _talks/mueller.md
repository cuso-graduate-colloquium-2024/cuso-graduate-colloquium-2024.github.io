Finite cyclic groups, when viewed as compact subgroups embedded in the circle, exibit a form of self-duality with respect to the Fourier transform, though becoming discrete in the spectrum. Heuristically, these compact cyclic groups asymptotically approximate the circle, while their duals discrete copies correspond to approximation of the integers. Using heat kernels and spectral zeta functions, this relationship can be made rigorous, revealling interesting onnections to number theory.
